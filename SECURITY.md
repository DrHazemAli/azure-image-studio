Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **LinkedIn**: Send details to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hazemali/)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Environment**: OS, browser, and version information
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include a minimal proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After the issue is resolved and patches are available

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Data Protection

- **API Keys**: Never stored in client-side code
- **User Data**: Stored locally using IndexedDB
- **Generated Images**: Processed and stored securely
- **Configuration**: Sensitive data in environment variables only

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Azure Integration**: Secure API key authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **CORS**: Properly configured for security

### Code Security

- **Dependencies**: Regularly updated and scanned for vulnerabilities
- **TypeScript**: Type safety to prevent common vulnerabilities
- **ESLint**: Security-focused linting rules
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed for security implications

## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Key Security**
   - Never share your Azure API keys
   - Use environment variables for storage
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Monitor API usage

2. **Configuration Security**
   - Keep configuration files secure
   - Don't commit sensitive data to version control
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication where possible

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Keep your browser updated
   - Be cautious with browser extensions
   - Use a secure network connection

### For Developers

1. **Secure Development**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use `npm audit` regularly
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Use trusted package sources

3. **Code Review**
   - Review all code changes
   - Look for security vulnerabilities
   - Test security features
   - Document security considerations

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Client-Side Limitations

- **API Keys**: Must be handled securely on the client side
- **Generated Content**: Images are processed in the browser
- **Local Storage**: Data stored locally may be accessible to other scripts

### Azure Service Dependencies

- **Service Availability**: Depends on Azure service availability
- **Rate Limits**: Subject to Azure API rate limits
- **Data Processing**: Images processed by Azure AI services

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for Azure integration
AZURE_API_KEY=your_secure_api_key_here

# Optional security settings
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Azure Configuration

- **Endpoint Security**: Use HTTPS endpoints only
- **API Version**: Use supported API versions
- **Deployment Security**: Secure deployment configurations
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls
