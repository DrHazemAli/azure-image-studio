# Getting Started with Azure Image Studio

Welcome to Azure Image Studio! This guide will help you get up and running with our comprehensive AI-powered image generation and editing platform.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This is a **community project** and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Microsoft or Azure. It's an independent project that uses Azure AI services.

## üöÄ Quick Overview

Azure Image Studio is a community-developed, production-ready platform that integrates with Azure AI services to provide professional-grade image generation and editing capabilities. This independent project offers both a simple generation interface and a full-featured studio environment for advanced image manipulation.

**Note**: This is not an official Microsoft or Azure product, but rather a community project that utilizes Azure's AI services.

### Current Active Features

The platform currently supports two main feature categories:

- **üé® Image Generation**: Create images from text descriptions using various AI models
- **‚úèÔ∏è Image Editing**: Modify and enhance existing images with AI-powered tools

For detailed information about current and planned features, see our [Roadmap](Roadmap.md).

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed on your system
- **Azure subscription** with access to AI services
- **Azure OpenAI Service** account (for DALL-E 3 and GPT-Image-1 models)
- **Azure AI Foundry** access (for FLUX models)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DrHazemAli/azure-image-studio.git
cd azure-image-studio
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Azure Services

The platform uses a flexible configuration system that supports multiple Azure endpoints and models.

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Azure API Key (used for all models)
AZURE_API_KEY=your_azure_api_key_here
```

#### Model Configuration

Edit the configuration files in `src/app/config/`:

**`azure-config.json`** - Main endpoint configuration:
```json
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "id": "primary",
      "name": "Primary Endpoint",
      "baseUrl": "https://your-openai-endpoint.openai.azure.com",
      "apiVersion": "2025-04-01-preview",
      "deployments": [
        {
          "id": "dalle-3",
          "name": "DALL-E 3",
          "deploymentName": "your-dalle-3-deployment",
          "maxSize": "1024x1024",
          "supportedFormats": ["png", "jpeg"],
          "description": "High-quality image generation with DALL-E 3"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**`azure-models.json`** - Detailed model specifications and capabilities:
```json
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "id": "primary-openai",
      "name": "Azure OpenAI Primary",
      "baseUrl": "https://your-openai-endpoint.openai.azure.com",
      "type": "openai",
      "deployments": [
        {
          "modelId": "dalle-3",
          "deploymentName": "your-dalle-3-deployment",
          "enabled": true
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "primary-foundry",
      "name": "Azure AI Foundry",
      "baseUrl": "https://ai-foundry.azure.com",
      "type": "foundry",
      "deployments": [
        {
          "modelId": "flux-1-1-pro",
          "deploymentName": "your-flux-deployment",
          "enabled": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

- **API Versions**: Each model may require different API versions

### Environment Setup

The platform automatically detects available models based on your configuration. Ensure:

1. All required deployments are created in Azure
2. API keys have proper permissions
3. Endpoints are correctly configured
4. Models are enabled in the configuration

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Azure API key not configured"**
- Ensure `AZURE_API_KEY` is set in your `.env.local` file

**"Invalid Azure configuration"**
- Check that your endpoint URLs are correct
- Verify deployment names match your Azure configuration
- Ensure API versions are compatible

**"Model not available"**
- Check if the model is enabled in `azure-models.json`
- Verify the deployment exists in Azure
- Ensure you have access to the required Azure service
