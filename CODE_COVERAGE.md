# Code Quality & Testing

**Last Updated**: September 8, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.2

## 🧪 Code Coverage

We maintain high code quality standards with comprehensive testing:

- **Code Coverage**: 85%+ across all modules
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite for utilities and components
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing and Azure service integration
- **E2E Tests**: End-to-end testing for critical user workflows
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with strict type checking

## 📊 Quality Metrics

- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency enforcement
- **Prettier**: Code formatting and style consistency
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking and error prevention
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle size and runtime performance

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
```

## 📈 Coverage Reports

Our testing framework provides detailed coverage reports for:

- **Frontend Components**: React components and hooks
- **API Routes**: Backend API endpoints and middleware
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface functionality
- **Utility Libraries**: Core business logic and helpers
- **Type Definitions**: TypeScript type safety validation

## 🔍 Quality Assurance

### Automated Testing

- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing on every pull request
